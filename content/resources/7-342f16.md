  caption: Fur coloration in calico and tortoiseshell cats is just one example of
    X chromosome inactivation, a process that occurs in mammalian females as a means
    of dosage compensation between males (XY) and females (XX). See [Week 6](/courses/7-342-the-rna-revolution-at-the-frontiers-of-cell-biology-and-molecular-medicine-fall-2016/pages/lecture-summaries)
    to learn more about the role of lncRNAs in X chromosome inactivation. (Photograph
